This week, I focused on improving the stability and performance of our mobile app.  I resolved three high-priority bugs that were affecting the login process and optimized the API calls to reduce loading times by approximately 25%.  
Additionally, I collaborated with the design team to refine the onboarding screens for a smoother user experience.  
I also wrote unit tests for the new features, increasing our code coverage from 68% to 82%.  
Next week, I plan to start integrating push notifications and user analytics tracking.
